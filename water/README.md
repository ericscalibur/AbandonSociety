# Water Security: Building Resilient Water Systems

*Creating reliable, clean water access for sustainable communities*

## Overview

Water is the foundation of all life and community resilience. This section provides comprehensive guidance for developing water security through collection, storage, treatment, and conservation systems that can sustain your community through droughts, contamination events, and infrastructure failures.

## Core Principles

### Water Cycle Integration
- Work with natural water flows rather than against them
- Capture water when abundant for use during scarcity
- Minimize contamination at every stage
- Design for multiple uses and reuse cycles

### Quality Hierarchy
1. **Potable**: Drinking, cooking, food preparation
2. **Clean**: Bathing, laundry, dishwashing
3. **Greywater**: Irrigation, toilet flushing
4. **Blackwater**: Composting toilets, constructed wetlands

### System Redundancy
- Multiple water sources (rain, wells, springs, surface water)
- Backup treatment methods
- Emergency storage reserves
- Distributed rather than centralized systems

## Water Assessment and Planning

### Current Usage Analysis
**Typical Household Water Use** (gallons per person per day):
- Drinking and cooking: 2-3 gallons
- Bathing and hygiene: 25-30 gallons  
- Laundry: 15-20 gallons
- Toilet flushing: 18-24 gallons
- Dishwashing: 4-6 gallons
- **Total: 64-83 gallons per person per day**

**Conservation Targets**:
- Efficient systems: 30-40 gallons per person per day
- Emergency rationing: 5-15 gallons per person per day
- Absolute minimum: 1 gallon per person per day (drinking only)

### Site Water Assessment

#### Climate Data
- [ ] Average annual precipitation
- [ ] Seasonal precipitation patterns
- [ ] Drought frequency and duration
- [ ] Temperature ranges affecting freezing
- [ ] Evaporation rates

#### Water Sources Inventory
- [ ] **Groundwater**: Wells, springs, water table depth
- [ ] **Surface Water**: Streams, ponds, seasonal flows
- [ ] **Precipitation**: Roof area, collection potential
- [ ] **Existing Systems**: Municipal connections, private wells
- [ ] **Legal Rights**: Water rights, usage restrictions

#### Quality Testing Requirements
**Basic Water Quality Parameters**:
- pH (6.5-8.5 optimal)
- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
- Hardness (mineral content)
- Bacterial contamination (E. coli, coliform)
- Nitrates (especially near agriculture)
- Heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic)

## Rainwater Harvesting

### Collection Systems

#### Roof Catchment Calculation
**Formula**: Roof Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (inches) × 0.623 = Gallons Collected
- 1,000 sq ft roof × 1" rain = 623 gallons
- Account for 10-15% loss from evaporation and splash

#### Roof Material Considerations
**Best Materials**:
- Metal roofing: Cleanest runoff, durable
- Clay/concrete tiles: Good quality after initial flush
- Composition shingles: Acceptable with first-flush diversion

**Avoid**:
- Asbestos shingles
- Lead-based paint
- Cedar shakes (tannins)
- Roofs with moss or debris

#### Gutter and Downspout Sizing
**Gutter Capacity**:
- 5" gutters handle up to 2,500 sq ft
- 6" gutters handle up to 3,800 sq ft
- Slope 1/4" per 10 feet toward downspouts

**Downspout Sizing**:
- 2"×3" downspouts: up to 600 sq ft
- 3"×4" downspouts: up to 1,200 sq ft
- Round downspouts: 3" diameter up to 700 sq ft

### First-Flush Diversion

#### Why First-Flush Diversion?
- Removes initial roof runoff containing debris, bird droppings, dust
- Significantly improves collected water quality
- Reduces tank cleaning requirements

#### Diverter Types
**Tipping Bucket Diverters**:
- Automatic operation
- Diverts first 10-20 gallons per 1,000 sq ft
- Self-draining between rain events

**Standing Pipe Diverters**:
- Simple T-fitting with standpipe
- Overflow goes to main tank
- Manual valve control

#### Calculating Diversion Volume
**Rule of Thumb**: Divert 0.01-0.02 gallons per square foot of roof
- 1,000 sq ft roof = divert 10-20 gallons
- 2,000 sq ft roof = divert 20-40 gallons

### Storage Systems

#### Tank Material Options
**Food-Grade Polyethylene**:
- Most common and cost-effective
- UV-resistant formulations available
- Sizes: 50-10,000+ gallons
- Pros: Lightweight, easy installation
- Cons: Can become brittle over time

**Fiberglass**:
- Excellent durability
- UV resistant
- More expensive than polyethylene
- Professional installation recommended

**Concrete**:
- Extremely durable (50+ year lifespan)
- Can be cast in place or preformed
- Excellent for large installations (5,000+ gallons)
- Requires proper sealing and pH management

**Ferrocement**:
- Steel mesh reinforced cement
- Good DIY option for custom shapes
- Requires skill in application
- Very durable when properly constructed

#### Storage Sizing Guidelines
**Minimum Storage**: 30-day supply at conservation usage rates
- Family of 4 × 30 gallons/day × 30 days = 3,600 gallons minimum

**Optimal Storage**: 60-90 day supply
- Accounts for seasonal dry periods
- Provides buffer for equipment maintenance
- Family of 4 = 7,200-10,800 gallons

**Cistern Design Considerations**:
- Opaque materials prevent algae growth

## Water Conservation Strategies

### Demand Reduction

#### Low-Flow Fixtures
**Toilets**:
- Standard: 3.5-7 gallons per flush
- Low-flow: 1.28-1.6 gallons per flush
- Dual-flush: 0.8/1.28 gallons (liquid/solid)
- Composting: Zero water use

**Showers and Faucets**:
- Standard showerheads: 2.5-5 gallons per minute
- Low-flow showerheads: 1.5-2.0 gallons per minute
- Aerating faucets: 1.0-1.5 gallons per minute
- Sensor-operated: Eliminates waste from leaving taps on

#### Behavioral Changes
**Simple Conservation Measures**:
- Shorter showers (save 2-5 gallons per minute reduced)
- Turn off tap while brushing teeth (save 1-2 gallons)
- Fix leaks immediately (dripping faucet wastes 3,000+ gallons/year)
- Full loads in dishwashers and washing machines
- Collect shower warm-up water for other uses

### Landscape Water Conservation

#### Xeriscaping Principles
1. **Planning and Design**: Group plants by water needs
2. **Soil Improvement**: Add organic matter for water retention
3. **Plant Selection**: Native and drought-adapted species
4. **Practical Turf**: Limit lawn to functional areas only
5. **Efficient Irrigation**: Drip systems and smart controllers
6. **Mulching**: 2-4 inches to reduce evaporation
7. **Maintenance**: Regular system checks and adjustments

#### Native Plant Benefits
- 50-80% less water requirements
- Better adapted to local climate extremes
- Support local wildlife and pollinators
- Lower maintenance once established
- Natural pest and disease resistance

## Emergency Water Preparedness

### Emergency Storage
**Minimum Emergency Storage**: 1 gallon per person per day for 3 days
**Recommended Storage**: 2 weeks supply (14 gallons per person)

#### Storage Methods
**Commercial Water Containers**:

### Emergency Purification Methods

#### Boiling
- Most reliable method for biological contamination
- Rolling boil for 1 minute (3 minutes above 6,500 feet elevation)
- Does not remove chemical contaminants
- Fuel requirements limit long-term use

#### Chemical Treatment
**Chlorine Bleach** (unscented, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite):
- 8 drops per gallon, mix and wait 30 minutes
- Double dose if water is cloudy
- Slight chlorine smell indicates proper dosing

**Iodine Tablets**:
- Follow manufacturer's instructions
- Not suitable for pregnant women or people with thyroid conditions
- Leaves taste that can be improved with vitamin C

#### Filtration Options
**Ceramic Filters**:
- Remove bacteria and parasites
- Long-lasting and cleanable
- Slow flow rate
- Do not remove viruses or chemicals

**Activated Carbon**:
- Removes chlorine, chemicals, improves taste
- Does not remove biological contaminants
- Must be combined with other treatment methods

**Reverse Osmosis**:
- Removes virtually all contaminants
- Requires pressure source
- Slow flow rate and water waste
- Excellent for comprehensive treatment

### Alternative Water Sources

#### Atmospheric Water Generation
**Fog Nets**:
- Mesh nets collect water from fog
- 1-3 gallons per day per 100 sq ft in suitable climates
- Requires consistent fog and wind patterns
- Low maintenance once installed

**Dew Collection**:
- Radiative cooling condenses atmospheric moisture
- Specialized surfaces increase collection
- 1-4 liters per square meter per night in ideal conditions
- Works best in arid climates with clear skies

#### Emergency Source Purification
**Rainwater from Any Surface**:
- First flush is most contaminated
- Filter through cloth to remove debris
- Treat with boiling or chemical disinfection

**Surface Water Sources**:
- Always treat water from ponds, streams, lakes
- Clear water upstream from contamination sources
- Multiple treatment methods recommended
- Test regularly if using long-term
